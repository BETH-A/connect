A web app that allows College Students to connect with each other. After creating an account and answering a short survey. Student input is stored in MySQL which is then called to display on the Student Wall.

Getting Started
Upon launching the website, the user will either choose to login (if they have an account) or create an account.

If they choose to create an account, the user will be directed to the Student Profile page.

Once the Student Profile is complete, the user is transitioned to Student Survey. This survey will give us some insight into the Student's interests.

Upon completion of the Student Survey, the user is directed to the Student Wall. The wall allows the user to view their profile and profile cards for other users.
